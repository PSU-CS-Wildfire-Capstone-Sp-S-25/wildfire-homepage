# 🔥 Predicting Wildfire Spread with the Coupled WRF-SFIRE Model

## ⚙️ Model Overview: WRF and SFIRE

### 💨 WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) Model

The WRF model is a next-generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications. It simulates atmospheric conditions by solving a set of complex differential equations that describe the physics of the atmosphere. Key features include:

* **High-Resolution Grids:** 🌐 WRF can be configured with nested domains to simulate atmospheric phenomena at various scales, from large-scale weather patterns down to fine-scale local winds.

* **Data Assimilation:** 🛰️ It can ingest real-time meteorological data to produce highly accurate, localized forecasts.

### 🔥 SFIRE: The Fire Spread Module

SFIRE is a fire-spread model integrated directly into WRF. It operates on the same grid as the atmospheric model and simulates the propagation of a fire front based on a semi-empirical rate of spread (ROS) model. The ROS is calculated based on:

* **Fuel Properties:** 🌿 Type, moisture content, and loading of vegetation.

* **Topography:** ⛰️ Slope of the terrain.

* **Local Weather:** 🌡️ Wind speed and direction at the fire's location, provided directly by WRF.

## 🔗 The Power of Coupling: Fire-Atmosphere Interaction

The key innovation of the WRF-SFIRE system is its **two-way coupling**. This means that the fire and the atmosphere models influence each other in real-time within the simulation:

1.  **Atmosphere-to-Fire (🌬️➡️🔥):** The WRF model provides the SFIRE module with high-resolution, dynamically updated wind fields, temperature, and humidity, which directly govern the fire's rate and direction of spread.

2.  **Fire-to-Atmosphere (🔥➡️🌬️):** The SFIRE module calculates the heat and water vapor fluxes released by the fire. These fluxes are then fed back into the WRF model, altering the local atmospheric conditions. This feedback loop allows the simulation to capture critical phenomena like fire-induced winds and pyrocumulus cloud formation, which can drastically alter fire behavior.

## 📊 Visualization with `wrfxweb`

`wrfxweb` is a web-based visualization tool specifically designed to process and display the outputs from WRF-SFIRE simulations. It generates intuitive and dynamic visualizations that are ideal for analysis and public dissemination.

* **Input:** `wrfxweb` takes the standard `wrfout` files generated by a WRF-SFIRE run.

* **Output:** It produces a variety of visual products, including animated GIFs and interactive maps that can be embedded directly into websites. These visuals typically show the fire perimeter's progression over time, overlaid with relevant weather data like wind vectors or heat release contours.
